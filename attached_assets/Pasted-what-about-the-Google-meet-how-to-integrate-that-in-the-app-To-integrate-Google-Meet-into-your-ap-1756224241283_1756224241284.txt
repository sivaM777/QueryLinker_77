what about the Google meet how to integrate that in the app

To integrate *Google Meet* into your app (similar to what you planned for Teams), the best, official method is using the *Google Meet REST API*. This allows you to create/manage meetings programmatically and offer meeting links directly from your app UI for ServiceNow ITSM or QueryLinker scenarios[1][2].

***

## Step-by-Step Guide: Google Meet Integration

### 1. Set Up Google Cloud Project & Enable APIs
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
- Create a new project (e.g., “QueryLinker Integration”).
- Enable these APIs:
   - Google Meet API (in some cases, also Google Calendar API—needed for creating Meet links within events)[3][1].
- Go to “APIs & Services” → “OAuth consent screen” to configure your app details.

### 2. Configure OAuth 2.0 Credentials
- In the Cloud Console, go to “APIs & Services” → “Credentials.”
- Click “+ Create Credentials” → “OAuth client ID.”
- Select application type (typically Web Application for integrations).
- Enter *redirect URIs* (e.g., your ServiceNow/Replit callback endpoint).
- Save and note down your *Client ID* and *Client Secret*[3][1].

### 3. Implement OAuth Flow in Your App
- When a user triggers a Google Meet-related action, redirect them to the Google OAuth consent screen for sign-in and permissions.
- On successful authentication, your app receives an *access token* for Google Meet/Calendar APIs.

### 4. Create a Google Meet Meeting via API
- Use the *Google Calendar API* to insert a calendar event with a Meet link, because the standard method for programmatic Meet creation is to make a Calendar event that includes Meet conferencing like this:
javascript
// Example for Node.js/JavaScript backend
const { google } = require('googleapis');
const calendar = google.calendar('v3');

const event = {
  summary: "ITSM Support Call",
  description: "Incident resolution discussion",
  start: { dateTime: "2025-08-28T10:00:00+05:30" },
  end: { dateTime: "2025-08-28T10:30:00+05:30" },
  conferenceData: {
    createRequest: {
      requestId: Math.random().toString(36).substring(7),
      conferenceSolutionKey: { type: "hangoutsMeet" }
    }
  }
};

calendar.events.insert({
  auth, // your authorized OAuth2 client
  calendarId: 'primary',
  resource: event,
  conferenceDataVersion: 1
}, (err, res) => {
  if (err) return console.error('API Error:', err);
  console.log('Meet Link:', res.data.hangoutLink);
});

- The resulting event will contain a hangoutLink (Google Meet join URL)[3][4].

### 5. Display and Use Meet Link
- Show the Meet link (hangoutLink) in your ServiceNow ticket, Replit app UI, or send via notification.
- Users can click and join, just like with Teams join URLs.

### 6. Optional: Manage/Sync Meetings
- You can list, update, or delete meetings/events via the Google Calendar API.
- To go deeper (e.g., participant info or meeting events), also explore the latest Google Meet REST API features[1][2].

***

## Key Points

- Google Meet API relies on OAuth 2.0 for user consent and secure integration.
- Actual “meeting creation” happens by adding a calendar event with a Meet conference (not via a “create meeting” endpoint alone)[3][1][4].
- You must enable relevant APIs and configure your authentication flow as you did with Microsoft Graph.
