Prompt: Real-Time IT Service Problem Aggregation Database
Create a PostgreSQL-backed database and API system that collects, normalizes, and serves real-time IT service incident and problem data aggregated from multiple free and public ITSM and service status sources. The system should support integration with various external IT service problem data sources via their APIs and provide a unified, queryable interface for frontend clients with real-time update capabilities.

Requirements
Build connectors to periodically fetch or subscribe to incident and status updates from multiple free/public ITSM and service status APIs.

Normalize incident data (including system name, incident ID, status, timestamps, descriptions, severity, external reference URLs) into a common schema and store in PostgreSQL.

Provide REST and/or GraphQL endpoints to query incidents by system, status, severity, time range, etc.

Implement real-time communication with frontend clients via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events to push live incident updates.

Support OAuth or API key-based authentication where required to access external APIs.

Enable dynamic registration of new data sources/systems with sync intervals and authentication settings.

Implement caching, retry, and error handling strategies for robust data collection.

Ensure secure design with input validation, rate limiting, and secure credentials handling.
