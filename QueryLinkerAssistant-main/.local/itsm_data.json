      "description": "On August 21, 2025, from approximately 15:37 UTC to 18:10 UTC, customers experienced increased delays and failures when starting jobs on GitHub Actions using standard hosted runners. This was caused by connectivity issues in our East US region, which prevented runners from retrieving jobs and sending progress updates. As a result, capacity was significantly reduced, especially for busier configurations, leading to queuing and service interruptions. Approximately 8.05% of jobs on public standard Ubuntu24 runners and 3.4% of jobs on private standard Ubuntu24 runners did not start as expected.<br /><br />By 18:10 UTC, we had mitigated the issue by provisioning additional resources in the affected region and burning down the backlog of queued runner assignments. By the end of that day, we deployed changes to improve runner connectivity resilience and graceful degradation in similar situations.  We are also taking further steps to improve system resiliency by enhancing observability of network connection health with runners and improving load distribution and failover handling to help prevent similar issues in the future.",

      "description": "Between July 28, 2025 16:31 UTC to July 29, 2025 12:05 UTC users saw degraded Git Operations for raw file downloads. On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

This was due to resource provisioning failures in one of our datacenter regions. During this period, approximately 2% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on private repos were delayed. Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and public repo workflows were unaffected.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue, additional worker capacity was added from a different datacenter region at 15:35 UTC and further increased at 16:00 UTC. By 16:30 UTC, job queues were healthy and service was operating normally. Since the incident, we have deployed changes to improve how regional health is accounted for when allocating new runners, and we are investigating further improvements to our automated capacity scaling logic and manual overrides to prevent a recurrence.",

After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.<br /><br />This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

      "description": "On June 6, 2025, an update to mitigate a previous incident led to automated scaling of database infrastructure used by Copilot Coding Agent. The clients of the service were not implemented to automatically handle an extra partition. Hence it was unable to retrieve data across partitions, resulting in unexpected 404 errors.\n\nAs a result, approximately 17% of coding sessions displayed an incorrect final state - such as sessions appearing in-progress when they were actually completed. Additionally, some Copilot-authored pull requests were missing timeline events indicating task completion. Importantly, this did not affect Copilot Coding Agent’s ability to finish code tasks and submit pull requests.\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future we are taking steps to improve our systems and monitoring.",

The impact extended beyond Actions itself - 60% of Copilot Coding Agent sessions were cancelled, and all Pages sites using branch-based builds failed to deploy (though Pages serving remained unaffected). The issue was caused by a spike in load between internal Actions services exposing a misconfiguration that caused throttling of requests in the critical path of run starts. We mitigated the incident by correcting the service configuration to prevent throttling and have updated our deployment process to ensure the correct configuration is preserved moving forward.",

Copilot saw an average of 36% of requests fail with a peak failure rate of 77%. Approximately 2% of all non-Copilot Web and REST API traffic requests failed.<br /><br />This incident occurred after a stale schema cache was used following a database migration. This led to a large number of failed queries. At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.<br /><br />We have implemented a block for this failure mode as an immediate solution and are actively working to add safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.",
